Hi, I have added an NDA file.
First of all I want to thank you for showing your interest in the project.

What I need to develop is a web app that will not need to be published on any store or website. It will have to be run only locally through a browser, preferably chrome.

In this way, through OBS and OBS ninja I will be able to integrate the Chrome window on which the game runs and the web cameras of the competitors.

It will aim to get disabled or handicapped kids to play from their homes. I will be the host of this game and follow the commands they dictate to me. The experience will be similar to a television show. It is a non-profit project. The screens in the game will be driven by a button panel. Each screen change will have a graphic curtain that will allow me enough time to change the scene on OBS.

Being a BIBLE-based puzzle game, there will be a link to an xml file from which chapter titles and book names will be taken.

The game consists of 3 types of puzzle games.

One similar to wheel of fortune, one of hidden words and the last one of finding the word intruder. In the latter there must be human control.

Another type of game involves answering a question, and there is a file for this too, but in csv format.

The total number of screens in the game is 7. The graphics have already been made on XD.

Being a game not to be published and that will run exclusively locally and not having profit the budget is kept to a minimum.
Players will not actually have to have their own play station. It is not a real time multi game. It's like a single player because it will be run by a single user.

The people interfacing will be voice guided via webcam.

Hello, thanks for your reply!

I understood your task, it sounds really interesting and I am confident to achieve this for you, since I mainly write computer games. 

I have a few questions:

Are the button panels hardware or shall I program software button panels for you?

What file format do the graphic files have? Are they simple pictures or are they animations?

I assume that the 7 screens are not all visible at the same time, but that there is always one screen visible at a time.

The loading of XML and CSV data is of course doable, and I will easily implement the game logic after you explain it in more detail.

Since you will record the app using OBS and OBS ninja, I will implement this game not as a web application, but as a normal application that you simply start on your desktop. I presume your computer uses a Windows system?

I'm looking forward working for you! I will communicate with you while developing your app and show you results in-between. 

I have just tried out OBS ninja, it can be used together with non-web applications.
